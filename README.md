#### Introduction 
This project aims to look into the guest experiences at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). By utilizing data-driven approach, predictive modeling and agent-based modeling, we want to optimize the guest flow and improve guest satisfaction, looking to potentially boost operational efficiency and revenue for USS. 

#### How the project came about? (Problems faced by entertainment venues)

#### What are the motivations of the project?

#### What problems the project hopes to solve?
The project hopes to dive into identifying various aspects affecting guest experiences in the USS, both positively and negatively. Understanding the variety of factors, more importantly, the weight of each of these factors, could help us unravel what are the considerations to be made when boosting guest journey in USS. 

#### What is the intended use of the project?

#### CONTENT OF THE PROJECT (INFORMATION + DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS) 

#### Benefits of the project 

#### Limitations of the project
For the optimization model, the results were significant in demonstrating the impact on ride attractions, however, there are limited information to how the changes made an impact to the eateries and souvenir shops. This is mainly due to the lack of comprehensive information that could possibly account for the crowd present at these places, causing the model to be limited in reflecting accurate wait times (wait time results showed little to zero wait times for these places) for these places.
