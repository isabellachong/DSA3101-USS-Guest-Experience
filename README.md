## Enhancing Guest Experience Through Data-Driven Journey Mapping and Analysis 

#### Introduction üéâ

This project aims to analyze guest experiences at Universal Studios Singapore (USS), addressing growing concerns about increasing dissatisfaction rates among visitors. Despite efforts to enhance guest satisfaction, USS has struggled to pinpoint the key factors driving this decline, making it difficult to implement targeted improvements.

By leveraging a data-driven approach, predictive modeling and agent-based simulations, this project seeks to optimize guest flow and enhance the overall visitor experience. Poor satisfaction ratings can lead to declining attendance, reduced revenue, and ultimately lower profitability for USS. By identifying and addressing pain points, the project aims to boost operational efficiency, improve guest satisfaction and drive revenue growth, ensuring USS remains a top entertainment destination.

#### How the project came about - Problems faced by entertainment venues ‚ö†Ô∏è

The project was initiated in response to growing challenges faced by Universal Studios Singapore (USS) in maintaining high guest satisfaction amidst evolving visitor expectations. In recent years, demographic shifts have led to a more diverse audience with varied preferences and demands, making it increasingly difficult to cater to all guest segments effectively. Additionally, guest dissatisfaction rates have been rising, with common complaints related to long wait times, overcrowding, inefficient park layouts and inconsistent service quality.

Despite USS's efforts to enhance operations, they have struggled to pinpoint the exact causes behind this growing dissatisfaction. This issue is critical because poor guest experiences can lead to negative reviews, reduced visitor retention, lower attendance, and ultimately a decline in revenue and profitability. Furthermore, the increased reliance on digital experiences and higher expectations for seamless, personalized services put additional pressure on theme parks to modernize their approach. Recognizing these challenges, this project was developed to leverage data-driven insights, predictive modeling and agent-based simulations to identify inefficiencies, optimize guest flow and enhance overall satisfaction, ultimately improving USS‚Äôs long-term operational success.

#### What are the motivations of the project? ü§©

The motivation behind this project stems from USS‚Äôs need to accurately identify and address the root causes of increasing customer dissatisfaction. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance visitor experiences, USS has struggled to pinpoint specific pain points that contribute to negative reviews, reduced visitor retention and declining profitability. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to analyze satisfaction trends, identify key drivers of dissatisfaction and develop targeted solutions to improve overall guest experiences. 

Another crucial motivation is to better understand changing visitor demographics and their evolving expectations. With shifting consumer behaviors and preferences, USS must be able to segment guests based on their interests, behaviors and visit patterns, allowing for a more personalized and efficient approach to park management. Through advanced analytics and predictive modeling, this project seeks to identify market trends and develop strategic initiatives tailored to different customer segments. By optimizing guest flow, enhancing operational efficiency and designing customized experiences for various demographics, the project ultimately aims to boost visitor satisfaction, increase attendance and maximize revenue for USS in an increasingly competitive entertainment industry.

#### What problems the project hopes to solve?

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of the various factors influencing guest experiences at USS, both positively and negatively. By examining these aspects, the project seeks to not only identify key drivers of visitor satisfaction and dissatisfaction but also to quantify the relative impact of each factor on the overall guest journey. Understanding the significance of these factors such as wait times, attraction availability, crowd density, staff interactions, pricing, and amenities is crucial in developing effective strategies to enhance visitor experiences. More importantly, by determining the weight and influence of each contributing element, USS can make data-driven decisions to optimize park operations, improve guest engagement and implement targeted improvements. This insight will help USS prioritize enhancements that yield the highest impact on customer satisfaction, ultimately leading to a more seamless, enjoyable and memorable theme park experience.

#### What is the intended use of the project?
The insights gleaned from our analysis of the data we collected through our survey and datasets available online would provide insights into the various factors affecting guest satisfaction levels at USS. Through guest segmentation, we can learn about different guest behaviours and how they respond to changes in certain aspects, both park-related (e.g. variety of rides, quality of customer service) and external (e.g. weather, holidays). These insights can then help USS tailor their promotions and operational strategies to better meet the needs of distinct guest segments.

#### Limitations of the project üòî

While the optimization model provided valuable insights into the impact of changes on ride attractions, there are several limitations that affect the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the results obtained. 

1) Limited Impact Assessment on Eateries and Souvenir Shops ‚Äì The model effectively analyzed ride attraction efficiency, but due to the lack of comprehensive data on crowd distribution in eateries and souvenir shops, it was unable to accurately reflect wait times for these locations. As a result, the model reported little to zero wait times, which may not be an accurate representation of real-world conditions.

2) Lack of Sufficient Survey Data ‚Äì The analysis relied on survey responses, but only around 500+ responses were collected, which may not be statistically representative of the full range of visitor experiences at USS. A larger sample size would improve the reliability of insights into customer satisfaction, preferences and pain points.

3) Limited Scope of Machine Learning Models ‚Äì Due to data constraints, only a select number of Machine Learning models were applied to analyze trends and predict guest experiences. A wider selection of models, including deep learning techniques and reinforcement learning, could have provided more nuanced insights but were not feasible within the project's scope.

4) Use of External Datasets ‚Äì Some datasets used in the analysis were sourced from Universal Studios locations outside of Singapore, which may not fully reflect USS‚Äôs unique visitor behaviors, crowd flow patterns or operational challenges. While data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted to enhance accuracy, differences in park layouts, local visitor demographics and cultural preferences may still introduce inconsistencies in the findings.

5) Challenges in Forecasting Future Visitor Trends ‚Äì The project primarily focused on analyzing historical and current data, making it difficult to accurately forecast future visitor flow and satisfaction trends. Additionally, external factors such as seasonal events, economic conditions, global travel restrictions and new attraction launches were not explicitly modeled, potentially impacting the long-term applicability of the results.
