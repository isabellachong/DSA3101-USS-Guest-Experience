The columns include the email address of the survey responders, as well as their responses to the 20 questions in the survey (some of the survey questions have various subparts, hence more than 20 columns altogether). We currently have 505 survey responses in our dataset.

Since the email address is considered highly confidential, in order to maintain data integrity to prevent exposure of information and privacy leaks, we should remove the `email address` column. Also, the `time_entry` column is not really important in our analysis as this column just represents when the respondants have completed the survey (within a period of a few days, all recent entries). We can also remove the column.

### Business Question 4: Impact Of Marketing Strategies On Guest Behaviour

#### Overview Of Using Marketing Strategies:

To assess the impact of marketing strategies on guest behavior, it is essential to first identify the characteristics of customers who spend at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). Tailoring marketing efforts to underrepresented groups without considering the broader customer base may limit their effectiveness in enhancing the overall guest experience. This, in turn, could result in minimal or no significant increase in demand for USS, potentially restricting revenue growth and preventing the park from maximizing its financial performance.

However, merely identifying customer characteristics is not sufficient to develop effective marketing strategies. It is equally important to analyze shifts in customer trends over time—for example, observing a consistent increase in the percentage of visitors aged 13 to 21. By tracking these evolving patterns, USS can better predict future customer demographics and tailor its marketing efforts accordingly.

Focusing on growing customer segments allows USS to implement targeted strategies that align with emerging trends, maximizing demand and ensuring sustained business growth. By comparing past demographic data with current visitor profiles, we can assess percentage changes across different customer segments. This analysis enables USS to better understand evolving visitor trends and develop targeted strategies to align with shifting consumer behaviors.

We need to analyze past campaign data to study changes in guest segment size and satisfaction. To identify trends and analyze shifts in customer patterns, it is essential to utilize historical demographic data from visitors to Universal Studios Singapore (USS), ideally from 10 or more years ago. This long-term dataset provides a more accurate basis for trend analysis, minimizing short-term fluctuations and errors.

To tackle this business question, we need to

Step 1: From the current survey dataset, we will obtain and analyze the demographics of visitors, including age range, visitor type, gender, salary range as well as time of visitations and special occasions

Step 2: Similar to Step 1, we will obtain and analyze the the demographics of visitors who visited USS some time ago

Step 3: We will then compare the demographics of current visitors versus visitors several years ago using some visualizations + identify some noticeable increasing trends, as well as the majority classes

Step 4: We will implement effective strategies to tailor to these large groups of people to increase user experience and ultimately increase revenue/profits for USS

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#### Step 1: Obtain And Analyze The Demographics Of Current Visitors In USS

From the current survey dataset that we have obtained, we can categorize the guest types based on several factors listed below:

*   **Visitor Demographics - Age, Gender, Nationality (Tourist/Local)**
*   **Visitor Type - Solo Travellor/Visiting With Friends/Family/Children etc.**
*   **Time Of Day - Weekdays/Weekends/Public Holidays etc.**
*   **Special Events - Halloween/Christmas etc.**

We will explore each bullet point one by one. We will first start with the Visitor Demographics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Visitor Demographics

For the point on Visitor Demographics, there are several features that we can explore. These include:

*   **Age Of Visitors**
*   **Gender Of Visitors**
*   **Nationality Of Visitors (Tourists/Local)**

###### Age Of Visitors

First, for the age of visitors, we split the visitors ages into various categories, such as

1.   Below 12 years old (Children)
1.   13 to 20 years old (Teenagers)
3.   21 to 34 years old (Young Adults)
4.   35 to 49 years old (Mid-Career Adults)
5.   50 to 64 years old (Mature Adults)
6.   65 years old and above (Seniors)

We can plot the number of each type of visitors using a bar chart, categrorized by age group. The column that we will be focusing on is `q2_1` (What is your age range?)
"""

# Define function to get number of responses by age category
def get_age_count(df, is_current=True):
  '''
  Args:
    df: DataFrame containing dataset
    is_current: Boolean indicating if data is current survey responses (True)
                or historical reviews (False)
  Returns:
    age_count: Series containing count of each age category
  '''

  # Specify order
  order = ["Below 12 Years Old", "13 To 20 Years Old", "21 To 34 Years Old",
         "35 To 49 Years Old", "50 To 64 Years Old", "65 Years Old And Above"]

  if is_current:
    age_count = df['q2_1'].value_counts().reindex(order, fill_value=0)
  else:
    age_count = df['age_range'].value_counts().reindex(order, fill_value=0)

  age_count.index = pd.Categorical(age_count.index, categories=order, ordered=True)

  return age_count

    title: Plot title
    xlabel: x-axis label
    ylabel: y-axis label
    color: Bar color
    rotation: x-tick label rotation
  '''
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
  bars = plt.bar(range(len(data)), data.values, color=color)

  plt.title(title)
  plt.xlabel(xlabel)
  plt.ylabel(ylabel)
  plt.xticks(range(len(data)), data.index, rotation=rotation, ha='right')
  plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3)

  # Add count labels
  for bar in bars:
        height = bar.get_height()
        plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., height + 1,
                 f'{int(height)}',
                 ha='center', va='bottom')

  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()

# Get responses count by age category
age_count_current = get_age_count(df)

# Plot bar chart of number of responses by age category
plot_bar(age_count_current,
          title='Number Of Respondents Based On Age Range (Current Data)',
          xlabel='Age Range Categories',
          ylabel='Number of Respondents')

"""Key Observations And Insights:

1) The age range category that has the highest number of respondants is 21 To 34 Years Old (Young Adults). This is followed by 13 To 20 Years Old (Teenagers) and Below 12 Years Old (Children).

2) The number of respondants aged 34 years and below contributes to the majority of the total number of survey responses, almost 75% of the total number of respondants are in this age range.

3) From 35 years old onwards, the bar graph shows a continuous decline in the number of respondants. The lowest number of respondants turned out to be 65 years old and above (Elderly).

We will analyse the age range categories further using heatmaps further in Step 3 when we are interested in comparing the proportions of respondants with particular age ranges over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Gender Of Visitors

We can plot the proportion of gender of visitors using a pie chart. The column that we will be focusing on is `q2_2` (What is your gender?)

***NOTE: For simplicity, we only assume two possible genders - Male and Female. We have made this question a mandatory question for the survey respondants to answer and give them only two options to choose from. We have explained to the respondants on the main page that their information will be kept confidential and will not be exposed to the public or on any websites. The information will only be used for data analysis and insights.***

We can similarly plot the proportion of Nationality of visitors using a pie chart. The column that we will be focusing on is `q3` (Are you a tourist or a local?)

***NOTE: For simplicity, we only assume two possible answers - tourist or local. This is because if we ask the tourists further on which country that they are from, there will be a myriad of different answers as there are over 200 countries in the world. This might result in too many categories for us to analyze and given the limited number of survey responses that we have collected, some countries might only have 1 or 2 responses which cannot be used to compare differences subsequently in Step 3***

The types of visitors can be categorized as follows:

*   Solo Traveller
*   Visiting with Friends
*   Families with Young Children
*   Families with Teenagers
*   Families with Elderly

##### Time Of Day

For the feature on the Time Of Day, we can break down into two categories:

**1st Category: When do visitors usually spend their day at USS?**

**2nd Category: What time of the day constitutes the highest demand?**

###### Category 1:

For the first category of "When do visitors usually spend their day at USS?", we can make use of column `q10` (When do you usually visit theme parks or attractions like USS?). This question targets the day type aspect of visitation. We can make use of a bar graph to plot the number of responses who select the possible options below.

The Possible Options Include:

*   Weekdays
*   Weekends
*   Public Holidays
*   School Holidays
*   Special Events (Halloween, Summer Festival, Christmas)
*   Other Inputs By User (Can Be Anything)



However, users are allowed to select multiple options from the list above and hence, we cannot plot the bar graph immediately. We need to perform some data cleaning and manipulation first before visualizing.

First, we need to identify all the unique categories of `q10` as some users might have inputted their preferred days under the "Other Inputs By User" section of the survey question.
"""

# Replace "Special Events (...)" with "Special Events" using regex
q10_column = df['q10'].replace(r'Special Events \(.*\)', 'Special Events', regex=True)

# Flatten the list by splitting each entry by commas and then flattening it
flattened_list = [item.strip() for sublist in q10_list for item in sublist.split(',')]

# Find unique categories
unique_categories = set(flattened_list)
print(unique_categories)

"""We observe that there are other entries such as 'When I feel like it' and '1 day in 25 years' that are in the resulting set of unique values, but are not available in the fixed options in the survey.

Data Cleaning Process:

1) Extract the `q10` column of the dataset

2) Separate the options using the comma delimiter for entries with more than 1 option

3) Performing One-Hot Encoding to create new columns - `weekdays`, `weekends`, `public_holidays`, `school_holidays` and `special_events` and others in the set containing 0 for absence and 1 for presence

"""Key Observations And Insights:

1) Weekdays have the largest number of respondants (138), indicating that the majority of visitors might choose a weekday to visit USS. There might be several reasons such as avoiding large crowds on weekends and public holidays or that there might be certain promotions or discounts given on weekdays that entice customers to visit USS on a weekday instead.

2) School Holidays also contribute to a significant number of responses (108) probably because there are many school children and teenagers who are only able to visit USS in this period due to their school/work days.

3) Special Events account for the lowest number of respondants (77). This might be attributed to the fact that there are only some special events held in USS and some visitors might have visited other entertainment venues (not USS) in these occasions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Category 2:

For the second category of "What time of the day constitutes the highest demand?", we can make use of several columns of the dataset to answer the question. This question targets the time aspect of visitation.

The columns that we will consider include:

*   `q14_1`: At what time of the day do you usually visit roller coasters?
*   `q14_2`: At what time of the day do you usually visit water rides?
*   `q14_3`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit 3D/4D experiences?
*   `q14_4`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit performances?
*   `q14_5`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit roadshows?
*   `q14_6`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit eateries and restaurants?
*   `q14_7`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit souvenir shops?
*   `q14_8`:	At what time of the day do you usually visit other rides (carousel rides, teacup rides etc.)?


**However, these columns selected target the popular times for each attraction, which we are not focusing on for this business question. We are instead focusing on the most popular timings in USS in general (not specific to each attraction). Instead, we should modify the columns above such that we calculate the combined count of each time category for all the eight columns.**

We can make use of another bar graph to plot the number of responses who select the possible options below.

The Possible Options Include:

*   Early Morning (8am to 10am)
*   Late Morning (10am to 12pm)
*   Early Afternoon (12pm to 2pm)
*   Late Afternoon (2pm to 4pm)
*   Evening (4pm to 6pm)
*   Night (6pm to 9pm)
*   I Do Not Visit

For these questions, users are not allowed to select any other option or type other suitable timings. Hence, there are only six categories that we will consider.

This is followed by Evening (4pm to 6pm) and Early Afternoon (12pm to 2pm). We can conclude that the peak times of USS span from Midday to around 6pm in the evening.

2) The least popular timing is Early Morning (8am to 10am) when USS just opens and might be still too early for some individuals who might be asleep at this timing. Demand is not as high. Night (6pm to 9pm) also has a lower number of respondants as it might be too late for some individuals possibly due to the fact that they might have work/school the next day.

*   Weather Conditions
*   Holiday Seasons
*   Wait Times For Rides
*   Attraction Variety
*   **Special Events**

On the other hand, about 36% of survey respondents are not interested in any of the above events.

#### Step 2: Obtain And Analyze The Demographics Of Visitors Who Visited USS Some Time Ago

After analyzing the demographics of current visitors to Universal Studios Singapore (USS), we will now extend our analysis to past visitors.

To achieve this, we will utilize a survey dataset from Kaggle, which contains visitor data for various Universal Studios locations worldwide from 2010 to 2021 (spanning approximately 4 to 14 years ago). The dataset is made by combining all the reviews on Trip Advisor for the various Universal Studios around the world. This dataset will serve as our historical reference for examining visitor demographics and satisfaction scores. However, before proceeding with the analysis, we must first clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

5. `branch` - The Universal Studios branch the reviewer went
6. `time_of_day` - The time the reviewer prefers to go to USS
7. `visitor_type` - Who does the visitor go with (Family, Friends, Alone etc.)
8. `day_preferred` - What day does the reviewer prefer to go to USS
9. `written-date` - The time when the reviewer wrote the review
10. `rating` - The rating the reviewer gave to his/her Universal Studios Experience
11. `title` - The title the reviewer wrote on Trip Advisor
12. `review_text` - The review description that the reviewer gave on Trip Advisor

1) As seen from the bar chart above, over 83% of reviewers gave USS a rating of 4 and 5 on TripAdvisor, suggesting that they were generally satisfied with their experience. A minority (5.4%) expressed their dissatisfaction by giving ratings of 1 and 2.

2) The ratings of USS historically is generally higher compared to the satisfaction ratings of USS currently (the mode rating for historic data is 5 but the mode rating for the current USS is 7/10, which is only between 3 and 4 when translated to a scale of 5). This means that overall satisfaction of USS fell in the recent years.

#### Step 3: Compare The Visitor Demographics + Identify Trends And Majority Classes

Looking at the data in detail:

Children (Below 12 Years Old):
*   Current: 16.8%

*   Slight increase in children visiting currently

Teenagers (13 To 20 Years Old):

*   Current: 25.0%

*   Historical: 19.6%
*   Notable decrease of about 5.3 percentage points

Older Adults (50 To 64 Years Old):

*   Current: 7.7%
*   Historical: 15.3%
*   Substantial decrease of 7.6 percentage points, showing this demographic has become much less represented

Seniors (65 Years Old And Above):


*   Current: 4.0%
*   Historical: 4.8%
*   Slight decrease, but remains the smallest proportion in both datasets

Key Trends:

The visitor population has significantly shifted toward younger adults (21-34), which now make up nearly a third of all visitors. There has been a marked decline in middle-aged and older adult visitors (35-64 age groups). The proportion of children and teenagers remains relatively stable between the two periods. The current visitor profile is more heavily skewed toward younger demographics, with 74.1% of visitors under 35 years old (compared to 60.3% historically). The 50+ age groups collectively dropped from 20.1% historically to just 11.7% currently.

This suggests a strategic repositioning or changing appeal of USS, with significantly stronger attraction to young adults and slightly reduced engagement with older demographics.

2.   "Visiting With Friends" has increased significantly from 19.0% to 25.9%, suggesting USS has become more popular as a social destination.
3.   "Family With Elderly" has seen the most dramatic decrease, dropping from 18.0% to just 5.3% (a 12.7 percentage point decline).
4.  "Family With Teenagers" has increased substantially from 12.9% to 20.8%, an 8.1 percentage point increase.
5.  "Solo Traveller" visitation has increased from 13.0% to 18.8%.


These changes align with the previous demographic shifts observed:

The decline in elderly family visits corresponds with the overall reduction in older visitors. The increase in friend groups and solo travelers aligns with the shift toward younger adults (21-34). The growth in teenage family visits matches the stable proportion of teenage visitors we saw in the age breakdown.
Overall, USS has transitioned from being primarily a family destination (particularly for young children and elderly family members) to a more diversified attraction that appeals to varied groups, especially friends, solo visitors and families with teenagers.

2.   Historically, attendance was concentrated during weekends (29.6%) and public holidays (28.1%), which together accounted for 57.7% of visitors.
3.   Currently, weekdays have become the most popular time to visit (27.4%), followed by school holidays (21.5%).
4.   Weekend visitation has decreased substantially from 29.6% to 19.5% (a 10.1 percentage point decline).
5.   Public holiday visitation has dropped significantly from 28.1% to 16.3% (an 11.8 percentage point decrease).
6.   Special events have seen a dramatic increase in popularity, rising from just 3.4% to 15.3% (an 11.9 percentage point increase).
7.   School holiday visitation has increased from 14.9% to 21.5% (a 6.6 percentage point rise).

These changes align with the demographic shifts observed in previous charts:

The increase in weekday and special event visitation correlates with the rise in local visitors who likely have more flexibility to visit on non-peak days. The growth in school holiday attendance matches the increase in families with teenagers. The decrease in weekend and public holiday visitation suggests less reliance on tourism and out-of-town visitors.

Overall, USS has transitioned from a destination primarily visited during traditional peak tourism periods (weekends and public holidays) to one with more balanced attendance throughout different time periods, with special emphasis on weekdays, school holidays, and special events.

"""This heatmap presents the preferred time slot proportions comparing current versus historical data for USS, showing when during the day visitors prefer to attend.

Current Data:
*   Early Morning (8am to 10am): 13.8%
*   Late Morning (10am to 12pm): 16.4%
*   Early Afternoon (12pm to 2pm): 17.7%
*   Late Afternoon (2pm to 4pm): 20.0%
*   Evening (4pm to 6pm): 17.9%
*   Night (6pm to 9pm): 14.3%

Historical Data:
*   Early Morning (8am to 10am): 14.6%
*   Late Morning (10am to 12pm): 15.0%
*   Early Afternoon (12pm to 2pm): 16.1%
*   Late Afternoon (2pm to 4pm): 18.4%
*   Evening (4pm to 6pm): 21.4%
*   Night (6pm to 9pm): 14.6%

Key Trends:

1.   The time slot preferences show relatively modest changes compared to the more dramatic shifts observed in other demographic categories.
2.   Late afternoon (2pm to 4pm) has become the most popular time slot currently at 20.0%, while evening (4pm to 6pm) was historically the most popular at 21.4%.
3.   Evening visitation has decreased from 21.4% to 17.9% (a 3.5 percentage point decline).
4.   The current distribution is more balanced across time slots, with no single time period strongly dominating.
5.   Early afternoon and late morning have seen modest increases in popularity (1.6 and 1.4 percentage points respectively).
6.   Early morning and night time slots remain the least popular periods in both datasets, with minimal changes.

These time slot preference changes align with the broader demographic shifts:

The more evenly distributed time preferences may reflect the greater proportion of local visitors who have more flexibility in their visiting times. The slight decline in evening visits could relate to the decrease in tourist visitors, who might previously have preferred to visit attractions later in the day. The increased popularity of afternoon slots aligns with the growth in family and friend group visits.

#### Step 4: Implement Effective Strategies To Tailor To The Identified Groups

Before we propose effective strategies, we need to first determine the groups that are under-represented in the survey. This is to entice the groups of individuals who might initally not be interested in visiting USS in order to increase the overall demand for USS, as well as enhancing the guest experience at USS.

From the results obtained above, we can pinpoint certain groups that might not be visiting USS as much.

1. **The Elderly (Particularly 65 years and above)**
2. **Males (Dropping in proportions recently)**
3. **Tourists (Dropping in proportions recently)**

There are other groups of people that although still have fairly high proportions, it shows a downward trend from previous years. USS should also propose marketing strategies to entice these groups of people to continue visiting USS. These groups include

1.  **Families With Young Children (Dropped in proportions though still high)**
2.  **35 To 49 Year Olds (Working Adults)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Elderly**

1. Senior Discount Days: Offer exclusive senior citizen discounts on weekdays or off-peak periods (e.g., "Senior Citizens’ Special: 20% Off Tickets Every Wednesday")

Offering senior discounts during off-peak times can help fill up the park during slower periods, increasing overall attendance. By targeting seniors, USS attracts a demographic that might otherwise avoid peak pricing. Seniors visiting on discounted days are likely to spend on additional services such as food, beverages, merchandise, and special experiences. The sense of savings from the discount encourages seniors to purchase tickets and additional items that they might not have otherwise.

2. Group Discounts for Senior Groups: Provide group pricing for seniors visiting with family or friends

Offering group discounts encourages seniors to visit USS with their families or friends, which can increase group ticket sales. Group visits often lead to higher spending since more people are on-site, and each individual tends to purchase food, drinks, and souvenirs. Additionally, seniors visiting with companions will likely make use of other park amenities (such as VIP tours, photo packages, and merchandise). By offering a lower price for senior groups, USS can attract larger parties, thus improving both ticket sales and overall park revenue through group purchases and shared experiences.

3. Relaxation Zones: Designate calming rest areas with comfortable seating, shade, and gentle music for seniors to relax in between attractions

Relaxation zones enhance the experience for elderly visitors, encouraging them to stay longer in the park without feeling fatigued. This added comfort can lead to increased spending on food, drinks, and souvenirs as seniors take breaks in these areas. The zones also provide a sense of exclusivity and care, which could result in more seniors choosing USS as their destination for leisure, leading to repeat visits. Creating a positive and comfortable environment for older guests can also foster word-of-mouth promotion, attracting new visitors from within the same demographic, boosting future revenue.

4. Senior-Friendly Tours: Offer guided, leisurely-paced tours around the park

Senior-friendly tours can be monetized by charging an additional fee for guided experiences, adding another revenue stream to USS. These tours cater specifically to the interests and pace of elderly visitors, which not only enhances their experience but also offers them something they might be willing to pay for. Seniors often appreciate leisurely, informative tours that are easy to follow, and offering them the chance to learn about the history of USS.

5. Accessible Services: Promote accessibility options like wheelchair rentals, mobility aids, and priority seating for shows

Providing accessible services like wheelchair rentals and priority seating ensures that elderly visitors, especially those with mobility issues, can fully enjoy the park without feeling restricted. The availability of mobility aids makes USS more inclusive, attracting a wider range of seniors, including those who may have previously thought the park was not accessible to them. By offering these services, USS not only increases the likelihood of senior visits but also generates additional revenue from rentals and premium services like priority seating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Males**

1. Increase Action-Packed Themed Attractions and Events: Focus on high-adrenaline, action-oriented rides and experiences, such as those based on blockbuster action movies (e.g., Fast & Furious, Transformers, Jurassic Park)

Men often enjoy intense, thrilling experiences. By emphasizing action-packed attractions, USS can increase ticket sales as these types of experiences tend to attract larger crowds. Additionally, special events can be ticketed separately, generating extra revenue. Merchandise related to these events (e.g., superhero or movie-themed items) can also drive increased sales. High-adrenaline attractions also encourage repeat visits, especially if new features or events are added over time.

2. Partnerships with Popular Male-Oriented Brands: Partner with well-known male-oriented brands (e.g., sports brands, gaming companies, or popular men's lifestyle brands)

Brand partnerships can draw new visitors who are loyal to specific brands, leading to increased foot traffic and engagement. Co-branded merchandise (e.g., limited-edition items from a popular gaming brand) can be sold, providing additional revenue. Additionally, exclusive partnerships often generate buzz and marketing opportunities, leading to greater awareness and attendance from the target demographic.

3. Sports Bar and Gaming Lounges: Set up sports bars or gaming lounges within the park where male visitors can watch live sports events, play games, or relax while enjoying food and drinks

Sports bars and gaming lounges create an opportunity to increase F&B revenue by offering food and drink packages. These venues are attractive for groups of male visitors who can socialize, relax, and spend time at the park in between attractions. By creating a space for leisure, USS can encourage visitors to stay longer in the park, increasing their overall spending on food, drinks, and potentially event tickets or VIP access to exclusive viewing areas for major events.

4. Adventure and Extreme Sports Experiences: Introduce extreme sports or adventure activities, such as virtual reality (VR) experiences, rock climbing, or even a high-flying experience like bungee jumping

Adventure and extreme sports experiences are often popular among men who seek thrilling, physically demanding activities. Charging for these activities separately or offering package deals can drive additional revenue. Such experiences can also increase the time visitors spend in the park, resulting in more spending on food, drinks, and merchandise. These types of attractions also encourage repeat visits from thrill-seekers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tourists**

1. Launch International Marketing Campaigns: Partner with international travel agencies, airlines, and influencers to launch targeted marketing campaigns in key tourist markets such as China, India and Southeast Asia

International tourists typically spend more on experiences, food, and souvenirs when visiting a theme park. By attracting more tourists from overseas, USS can tap into new revenue streams from foreign visitors who may also contribute to increased hotel bookings, travel packages, and extended stays. This kind of exposure boosts ticket sales, as well as demand for premium experiences like VIP tours and fast passes, which increase overall spending per guest.

2. Create Seasonal or Themed Events to Attract Tourists During Off-Peak Periods

Host special seasonal or limited-time themed events such as "Summer Fest" or "Halloween Horror Nights" to entice tourists during off-peak months. Promoting these events through global tourism channels can attract visitors specifically interested in these unique experiences. Special events generate excitement and urgency, encouraging tourists to visit USS during times when they might otherwise not have considered it. These events can drive up ticket prices for exclusive access, increase the sale of themed merchandise, and boost spending on food and beverage items. The demand for limited-time events can also increase park attendance during historically slower seasons, reducing revenue loss from lower off-peak visitation.

3. Offer Multi-Day Passes with Exclusive Benefits for Tourists: Introduce multi-day passes specifically targeted at tourists, which allow for unlimited access to USS and partner attractions over a certain number of days

Multi-day passes encourage tourists to spend more time at USS, potentially increasing per-visitor revenue. Tourists who purchase multi-day passes are more likely to spend on food, merchandise, and add-on services like express passes or special events. By offering exclusive benefits, USS also incentivizes higher-priced purchases and repeat visits during the tourist's stay in Singapore.

4. Develop Unique Tourist-Centric Experiences and Packages: Create unique experiences tailored to tourists - behind-the-scenes tours, private character meet-and-greets or exclusive access to new attractions

Unique, premium experiences can command higher prices and attract tourists willing to pay extra for exclusive access. Offering tailored experiences encourages tourists to spend more than they would on standard tickets, boosting overall revenue per guest. These high-value experiences can also be marketed as limited-time offers, increasing demand and encouraging tourists to visit USS sooner rather than later. Additionally, the luxury appeal of these experiences may attract high-net-worth tourists, further increasing revenue from premium offerings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Families with Young Children**

1. Family Passes: Offer bundles that include tickets for two adults and two children at a discounted rate.

Family bundles make the experience more affordable for families, which can lead to a higher volume of ticket sales. Families are more likely to purchase bundles, as they feel they are getting better value for money. The discounted rate encourages families to buy tickets for both parents and children at once, and they might also purchase additional services like food, merchandise, or express passes, boosting overall revenue. Offering bundled pricing creates a sense of cost savings, increasing the likelihood of families committing to a visit.

2. Free Entry for Toddlers: Provide free admission for children under 3 years old, making it more affordable for families.

While offering free admission to toddlers may seem like a loss of revenue for the very young group, it encourages families to visit USS in the first place. With younger children not being charged for tickets, families with toddlers are more likely to attend. These families will still contribute to revenue by spending on food, merchandise, photo ops, and additional experiences that are not discounted, which helps to offset the "free" entry for the toddlers. This approach also attracts more repeat visits as parents may return when they have multiple children of different age groups.

3. Interactive Learning Stations: Set up engaging, hands-on experiences related to the movies and themes (eg movie-making workshops, or behind-the-scenes shows)
Seasonal Family Events: Host special themed events (eg Christmas or Halloween) with kid-friendly activities

Interactive and educational experiences are highly attractive to families, especially when they are tied to popular movie themes that kids love. These types of experiences can be monetized through special admission fees or bundled with ticket sales as part of a premium package. Additionally, interactive stations encourage parents and children to spend more time at the venue, which leads to increased spending on food, drinks, souvenirs, and other experiences. Children's participation in workshops also leads to a memorable experience, increasing the likelihood of word-of-mouth recommendations and repeat visits, which drives future revenue.

4. Character Meet-and-Greets: Feature more kid-friendly characters apart from the usual ones that are currently available in USS for family photos and interactions

Character meet-and-greets are a major draw for families with young children. Offering popular, kid-friendly characters allows USS to charge a premium for exclusive photo opportunities or VIP meet-and-greet experiences. Families are willing to pay for these experiences to create lasting memories and unique interactions for their children. Additionally, character-themed merchandise can be sold at meet-and-greet locations, further increasing revenue from each family. The emotional connection created by meeting beloved characters encourages families to visit more often, especially if they know new characters or themed experiences are coming up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Working Adults**

1. After-Work or Late-Night Events: Host special after-work or late-night events that cater to working adults, such as "Happy Hour" events, themed parties, or exclusive access to certain attractions or shows during the evening

These events can drive attendance during typically off-peak hours, filling the park when it may otherwise be less crowded. By offering special events, USS can attract working adults who may not typically have the time to visit during the day, increasing overall ticket sales. The addition of exclusive experiences like VIP access, premium shows, or food and beverage deals can encourage working adults to spend more, boosting revenue from premium packages, food, drinks, and merchandise. The events can also include paid add-ons like drink tickets or special photo opportunities, further driving spending.

2. Corporate Partnership Packages: Partner with businesses and corporations to offer exclusive corporate discounts or team-building packages for employees

Corporate partnerships can lead to bulk ticket sales, generating significant revenue from organizations buying tickets for groups of employees. Team-building events or group outings create opportunities for USS to offer additional upsells, like lunch or dinner packages, private tours, or special events tailored to corporate groups. The exposure to corporate clients may encourage them to visit USS for personal trips, bringing in new customers and increasing repeat visits. Offering exclusive perks or experiences for employees can elevate the value proposition, driving higher ticket sales and additional purchases.

3. Weekend Relaxation and Wellness Packages: Develop relaxation and wellness-focused weekend packages, including stress-relief activities, spa experiences, or health-themed events

Wellness and relaxation activities can be a unique selling point for working adults looking for an alternative to traditional amusement park experiences. These experiences could be monetized through premium pricing for spa treatments, wellness seminars, or stress-relief activities like yoga sessions or nature walks. The packages can encourage longer stays, resulting in higher spending on food, merchandise, and optional add-ons. Offering wellness experiences could attract affluent working adults who may be willing to pay for higher-end experiences and services, leading to increased overall revenue.Marketing these packages as exclusive or limited-time offerings can drive demand and create a sense of urgency, boosting sales.

Satisfaction rates will increase if the following strategies are to be implemented. These strategies might help to achieve USS's goal of improving satisfaction rates to higher levels and at the same time, increase its revenue due to higher demand.**
